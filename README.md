You can see the demo [here](https://react-firebase-chat-red.vercel.app/)

## What it is

This is a chat app built by Firebase and React.
Users can join the chat without registration, it's a random chat.
The difference between the normal random and this chat is that

- It has the avatar from Star War.
- The users with the same avatar can't chat.(they won't be matched.)

## Start the project

This project is created with the help of CRA.
So you can start it as normal as other projects.
You can also use yarn if that is preferred.

Before starting, you have to setup Firebase app and set the correction values from Firebase to .env file.
Check the .env.example for the reference.

```
npm install
npm start
```
